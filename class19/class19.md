> Q3. Describe what happened after the introduction of the aP vaccine?

The number of pertussis cases began to increase after the introduction
of the aP vaccine. This could be due to the emergence of anti-vaccine
sentiments following the hysteria surrounding the mmr vaccine in the
late 90s.

## Exploring CMI-PB data

As we will be working with json files we need to call the library.

``` r
library(jsonlite)
```

Let’s now read the main subject database table from the CMI-PB API. You
can find out more about the content and format of this and other tables
here: https://www.cmi-pb.org/blog/understand-data/

``` r
subject <- read_json("https://www.cmi-pb.org/api/subject", simplifyVector = TRUE) 
```

``` r
head(subject, 3)
```

      subject_id infancy_vac biological_sex              ethnicity  race
    1          1          wP         Female Not Hispanic or Latino White
    2          2          wP         Female Not Hispanic or Latino White
    3          3          wP         Female                Unknown White

    2    1968-01-01    2019-01-28 2020_dataset
    3    1983-01-01    2016-10-10 2020_dataset

> Q4. How may aP and wP infancy vaccinated subjects are in the dataset?

``` r
table(subject$infancy_vac)
```


    aP wP 
    47 49 

> Q5. How many Male and Female subjects/patients are in the dataset?

``` r
table(subject$biological_sex)
```


    Female   Male 
        66     30 

> Q6. What is the breakdown of race and biological sex (e.g. number of
> Asian females, White males etc…)?

``` r
table(subject$race, subject$biological_sex)
```

                                               
                                                Female Male
      American Indian/Alaska Native                  0    1
      Asian                                         18    9
      Black or African American                      2    0
      More Than One Race                             8    2
      Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander      1    1
      Unknown or Not Reported                       10    4
      White                                         27   13

Side-Note: Working with dates

Two of the columns of subject contain dates in the Year-Month-Day
format. Recall from our last mini-project that dates and times can be
annoying to work with at the best of times. However, in R we have the
excellent lubridate package, which can make life allot easier. Here is a
quick example to get you started:

``` r
library(lubridate)
```


    Attaching package: 'lubridate'

    The following objects are masked from 'package:base':

        date, intersect, setdiff, union

``` r
today()
```

    [1] "2023-03-19"

How many days have passed since new year 2000

``` r
today() - ymd("2000-01-01")
```

    Time difference of 8478 days

What is this in years?

``` r
time_length( today() - ymd("2000-01-01"),  "years")
```

    [1] 23.2115

> Q7. Using this approach determine (i) the average age of wP
> individuals, (ii) the average age of aP individuals; and (iii) are
> they significantly different?

``` r
subject$age <- (today() - ymd(subject$year_of_birth))
```

``` r
library(dplyr)
```


    Attaching package: 'dplyr'

    The following objects are masked from 'package:stats':

        filter, lag

    The following objects are masked from 'package:base':

        intersect, setdiff, setequal, union

``` r
ap <- filter(subject, infancy_vac == "aP")

round( summary( time_length( ap$age, "years" ) ) )
```

       Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
         23      25      26      26      26      27 

``` r
wp <-  filter(subject, infancy_vac == "wP")
round( summary( time_length( wp$age, "years" ) ) )
```

       Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
         28      32      35      36      40      55 

The average ages of individuals with each vaccine is significantly
different \>Q8. Determine the age of all individuals at time of boost?

``` r
int <- ymd(subject$date_of_boost) - ymd(subject$year_of_birth)
age_at_boost <- time_length(int, "year")
head(age_at_boost)
```

    [1] 30.69678 51.07461 33.77413 28.65982 25.65914 28.77481

> Q9. With the help of a faceted boxplot (see below), do you think these
> two groups are significantly different?

``` r
ggplot(subject) +
  aes(time_length(age, "year"),
      fill=as.factor(infancy_vac)) +
  geom_histogram(show.legend=FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(vars(infancy_vac), nrow=2) 
```

    `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.

![](class19_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-19-1.png)

Yes these two groups seem significantly different from each other with
no overlap

Read the specimen and ab_titer tables into R and store the data as
specimen and titer named data frames.

``` r
specimen <- read_json("https://www.cmi-pb.org/api/specimen", simplifyVector = TRUE) 
titer <- read_json("https://www.cmi-pb.org/api/ab_titer", simplifyVector = TRUE) 
```

To know whether a given specimen_id comes from an aP or wP individual we
need to link (a.k.a. “join” or merge) our specimen and subject data
frames. The excellent dplyr package (that we have used previously) has a
family of join() functions that can help us with this common task:

> Q9. Complete the code to join specimen and subject tables to make a
> new merged data frame containing all specimen records along with their
> associated subject details:

``` r
meta <- full_join(specimen, subject)
```

    Joining with `by = join_by(subject_id)`

``` r
dim(meta)
```

Fim2/3 in particular appears to have its recognition change over time.
PRN also seems to have changed.

We can attempt to examine differences between wP and aP here by setting
color and/or facet values of the plot to include infancy_vac status (see
below). However these plots tend to be rather busy and thus hard to
interpret easily.

``` r
ggplot(ig1) +
  aes(MFI, antigen, col=infancy_vac ) +
  geom_boxplot(show.legend = FALSE) + 
  facet_wrap(vars(visit), nrow=2) +
  theme_bw()
```

![](class19_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-27-1.png)

Another version of this plot adding infancy_vac to the faceting:

``` r
ggplot(ig1) +
  aes(MFI, antigen, col=infancy_vac ) +
  geom_boxplot(show.legend = FALSE) + 
  facet_wrap(vars(infancy_vac, visit), nrow=2)
```

  facet_wrap(vars(visit)) +

```

![](class19_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-29-1.png)

the same for antigen==“FIM2/3”

``` r
filter(ig1, antigen=="FIM2/3") %>%
  ggplot() +
  aes(MFI, col=infancy_vac) +
  geom_boxplot(show.legend = TRUE) +
  facet_wrap(vars(visit)) +
  theme_bw()
```

> Q16. What do you notice about these two antigens time course and the
> FIM2/3 data in particular?

Measels stays relatively constant over time whereas the range and
magnitude of FIM2/3 seems to grow with each visit

> Q17. Do you see any clear difference in aP vs. wP responses?

While there are differences in the responses, even the most extreme
differences display an overlap between the median of one grouping and
the extremes of another. Differing responses were observed but not to a
significant level

## Obtaining CMI-PB RNASeq data

For RNA-Seq data the API query mechanism quickly hits the web browser
interface limit for file size. We will present alternative download
mechanisms for larger CMI-PB datasets in the next section. However, we
can still do “targeted” RNA-Seq querys via the web accessible API.

For example we can obtain RNA-Seq results for a specific ENSEMBLE gene
identifier or multiple identifiers combined with the & character:

# For example use the following URL

https://www.cmi-pb.org/api/v2/rnaseq?versioned_ensembl_gene_id=eq.ENSG00000211896.7

The link above is for the key gene involved in expressing any IgG1
antibody, namely the IGHG1 gene. Let’s read available RNA-Seq data for
this gene into R and investigate the time course of it’s gene expression
values.

``` r
url <- "https://www.cmi-pb.org/api/v2/rnaseq?versioned_ensembl_gene_id=eq.ENSG00000211896.7"

rna <- read_json(url, simplifyVector = TRUE) 
```

To facilitate further analysis we need to “join” the rna expression data
with our metadata meta, which is itself a join of sample and specimen
data. This will allow us to look at this genes TPM expression values
over aP/wP status and at different visits (i.e. times):

``` r
ssrna <- inner_join(rna, meta)
```

    Joining with `by = join_by(specimen_id)`

> Q18. Make a plot of the time course of gene expression for IGHG1 gene
> (i.e. a plot of visit vs. tpm).

``` r
ggplot(ssrna) +
  aes(visit, tpm, group=subject_id) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line(alpha=0.2)
```

![](class19_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-33-1.png)

> Q19.: What do you notice about the expression of this gene (i.e. when
> is it at it’s maximum level)?

It seems to be at its highest expression at the 4th visit

> Q20. Does this pattern in time match the trend of antibody titer data?
> If not, why not?

Although not matching the titer data, exactly both this data and the
titer trends show an increase in expression over time, peaking around
the 4/5/6 visit.

We can dig deeper and color and/or facet by infancy_vac status:

``` r
ggplot(ssrna) +
  aes(tpm, col=infancy_vac) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_wrap(vars(visit))
```

![](class19_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-34-1.png)

There is no obvious wP vs. aP differences here even if we focus in on a
particular visit:

``` r
ssrna %>%  
  filter(visit==4) %>% 
  ggplot() +
    aes(tpm, col=infancy_vac) + geom_density() + 
    geom_rug() 
```
